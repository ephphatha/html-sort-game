# html-sort-game
Gamified javascript/html webapp to allow manually performing bubblesort.

Esc/next move the cursor (selected items) to the right. Esc can also be used to cancel the confirm dialog at the end of a pass.  
Space/swap swap the two items under the cursor and also move the cursor one space to the right. Space can also be used to accept the confirm dialog at the end of a pass if the list is now sorted.

If you manually change the number of elements you will need to restart to generate a new list of that size.
